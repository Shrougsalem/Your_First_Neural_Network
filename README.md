# Predicting Bike-Sharing Data (Your First Neural Network)
The first project of Udacity's Deep Learning Nano-degree program. In this project, we'll build the first neural network and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership.

## Project Description
In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!<br/>
